## Website: Lead Capture Page

![page-showcase](app-showcase/page-showcase.png)

This project was created to be part of my portfolio. The page is a representation of a lead capture page built to be functional and responsive.

Created with accessibility resources, keyboard navigation and a great result with screen readers, this is what I believe is one of the most important things to pay attention to when creating a webpage nowadays.

The layout was built with SEO in mind, semantic HTML and advanced CSS skills and project organization. Everything is optimized and written in a clean way to be easily maintainable in the future.
